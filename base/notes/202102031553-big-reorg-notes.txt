Wed Feb  3 15:53:22 2021 OK, trying to reorg T2-12 for finer grain
cdmss and therefore lower-overhead updating.  Goals:

 - Don't reboot the tile unless pru or lkm stuff is affected
 - Move toward automated cdmss construction, if not release

Wed Feb  3 15:55:28 2021 First step is commit all this stuff we've had
hanging around for the last two weeks.. [2:

Thu Feb  4 13:16:51 2021 OK, trying out ssh access to github.  Let's
see if this commit goes smoothly (from a shell that doesn't have
ssh-agent running, I think).

Thu Feb  4 13:18:10 2021 So that gives us

    Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.112.4' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

so I guess we're committed to ssh-agent?  Or some args to git push?[4:

Thu Feb  4 14:07:07 2021 Well, so like:

    $ eval `ssh-agent`
    $ ssh-add  /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack
    Enter passphrase for /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack: 
    Identity added: /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack (ackley@ackleyshack.com)
    $ git push
