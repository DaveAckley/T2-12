Wed Feb  3 15:53:22 2021 OK, trying to reorg T2-12 for finer grain
cdmss and therefore lower-overhead updating.  Goals:

 - Don't reboot the tile unless pru or lkm stuff is affected
 - Move toward automated cdmss construction, if not release

[1:

Wed Feb  3 15:55:28 2021 First step is commit all this stuff we've had
hanging around for the last two weeks.. [5: DONE  :5][2:

Thu Feb  4 13:16:51 2021 OK, trying out ssh access to github.  Let's
see if this commit goes smoothly (from a shell that doesn't have
ssh-agent running, I think).

[3:

Thu Feb  4 13:18:10 2021 So that gives us

    Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,140.82.112.4' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

so I guess we're committed to ssh-agent?  Or some args to git push?[4:

Thu Feb  4 14:07:07 2021 Well, so like:

    $ eval `ssh-agent`
    $ ssh-add  /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack
    Enter passphrase for /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack:
    Identity added: /home/t2/.ssh/id_githack (ackley@ackleyshack.com)
    $ git push

Thu Feb  4 14:35:25 2021 So okay, what's the plan here?

Slot New dirs: Action       Containing old dirs and files:     Containing new dirs and files:

02   T2-12/    install      everything                          everything

05    base/    install      LICENSE Makefile README.md          LICENSE README.md Makefile base/
                            doc/ extra/ files/ notes/
                            packages/ pkgconfig/ services/
                            apps/sdlsplash apps/t2 apps/t2adm
                            apps/tnv
06     low/    reboot       pru/ lkms/                          lkms/ pru/
07     cdm/    restart      apps/cdm                            cdm.pl cdmctl cdm.sh cdm/ Makefile ..
08     mfm/    restart      apps/mfm                            mfm.pl mfm.sh Makefile RUN_SDL ..
[8:

Thu Feb  4 16:12:39 2021 So, cshould we start a T2-13 for this,
perhaps?[9:

Thu Feb  4 16:50:37 2021 Maybe let's do it in place, and consider
renaming the repo to T2-13 separately later.  But maybe let's do it
from a clean clone..

:8]
no: 04     cfg/    install      /home/t2/CONFIG-T2/
[7:

Thu Feb  4 16:01:26 2021 So T2-12 remains a single repo, but cdmss-02
will exclude everything that requires special handling -- low/ cdm/
mfm/ -- as well as our extremely lightweight cfg/.  Do we really want
cfg/ even in there?  Want to be committing every physics change, even
in principle?  Perhaps it's enough if mfm.pl can handle lack of
/home/t2/CONFIG-T2/ sensibly, and then we can leave /home/t2/CONFIG-T2
as is?

(All this is going to really have to be revisited when we REDO THE
DISK IMAGE GENERATION WORKFLOW RSN.)

[10:

Fri Feb  5 01:55:42 2021 OK, so we'd like to automate cdmss generation
enough to avoid generating a new ss if it looks like the directory is
up to date.  So how are we going to do that?  Should we have some
persistent intermediate output file that plain 'make' builds, and
'make cdmd' relies upon?  It wants to interact with stamp generation
probably?

:10]
[11:

Fri Feb  5 06:12:17 2021 So now I'm thinking I should keep slot 02 --
for now anyway -- as meaning 'the whole T2-12 repo', so that we might
have a hope of distributing the new T2-12 scheme using the existing
cdm setup.

:11]
[12:   

Fri Feb  5 12:42:30 2021 Well I've got to get the keymaste to a state
we can reboot in.. So I think I'm going to try to get back to branch
develop for now..

Committing.

:12]
[13:

Sat Feb  6 01:00:22 2021 OK back on branch T2-13.  What are some next
steps here?

   [16: Sat Feb  6 12:43:39 2021 Got 'Got cdmss-06-5205ec.mfz for low, tag = 5205ec, size = 1246421'
DONE :16] - Demo 'make' and 'make cdmd' in say low/, end up  with
   low/../cdmss-06-FFFFFF.mfz
   
   [17:
DONE :17] - Do NOT try to have cdmd construction be automatic on dependencies.
   Just do it when told as in existing flows, and blow up on repeated
   tag as in existing flows

   [18: Sat Feb  6 12:45:17 2021 OK, can we now

 - Make some SlotConfig hack to understand the low cdmss

 - Checking an appropriate tag, and not install/rebooting if set.

  :18]
:13][14:

Sat Feb  6 02:28:59 2021 Going back to develop to play with a1 a
little bit.

Committing

:14]
[15:

Sat Feb  6 12:34:56 2021 OK come on let's go T2-13.

Noting the '-f' in:

    root@beaglebone:/home/t2/T2-12# git checkout -f T2-13
    Checking out files: 100% (590/590), done.
    Switched to branch 'T2-13'
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/T2-13'.
    root@beaglebone:/home/t2/T2-12# 

to stomp on base/ and so forth in local branch.

[19:

Mon Feb  8 21:10:25 2021 Well, getting close to needing to test some
of this new layout, so we should think about committing first..

Basic ideas of new design:

 - '/home/t2/T2-12$ make cdmd' does nothing

 - '/home/t2/T2-12/(base|low|cdm|mfm)$ make cdmd' builds the
   corresponding cdmss (05..08) in /home/t2/T2-12

 - '/home/t2/T2-12$ make -f Makefile.slot02.mk cdmd' builds the
   old-style cdmss-02, intended for use only to transition the
   existing tiles.

 - '/home/t2/T2-12/mfm/CreatePhysicsSlot.pl' exists to initialize
   physics demos
