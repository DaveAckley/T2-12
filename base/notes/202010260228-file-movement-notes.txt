Mon Oct 26 02:29:12 2020 OK time to declare source-routed streams are
usable, at least a little bit, and pop up a level.

Let's think about scripts for a little file transfer protocol.

Maybe like:

srsend CLIENTROUTE [FILE ..]
srrecv SERVERROUTE DIR

Mon Oct 26 03:09:47 2020 OK, we have T2-12/apps/srf/srsend (perl)
starting to exist.  And it's connecting to our unix socket directly!
No nc needed!

Now we need our file transfer protocol.

I'm thinking like

CMD ARGS "\n"
<possible transparent data>
CMD ARGS "\n"

from client->server, maybe with a TAG in ARGS so the server can do like

STATUS TAG status "\n"

Mon Oct 26 03:29:00 2020 Like:

c->s
    SEND TAG FILENAME LENGTH "\n"
    byte x LENGTH opaque data

s->c
    STATUS TAG [READY|DONE hexchecksum|FAIL msg] "\n"

and more TBD, but let's just do that..

Mon Oct 26 03:36:43 2020 Maybe we should have a 'token' which acts
kind of like a port, in addition to the route.  With commands like

c->s
    HI TOKEN "\n"

s->c
    YEAH TOKEN "\n"    -- If token matches

    NAH "\n"           -- If not
     
or whatever

Mon Oct 26 03:53:29 2020 OK, did that (just using nc on the server
side).  Now for SEND

Mon Oct 26 10:01:00 2020 OK, 'srf' (does either srsend or srrecv
depending on route) committed.

Rough but edible dog food.
