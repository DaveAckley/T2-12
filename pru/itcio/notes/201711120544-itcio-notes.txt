Sun Nov 12 12:54:47 2017 Yay we finally have 'go.el' on the tiles!  Or
at least the subset of go.el that we actually use..

Sun Nov 12 12:55:31 2017 So, we're here to have a place to discuss all
the issues of talking packets back and forth between the PRUs and
kernelspace and userspace.

Of course we're way in the middle of things here.  One current issue
is: Do we need a custom LKM for this at all, or could we just use some
existing thing that presents RPMsg IO to userspace?  We've seen claims
that some demo or some kind of module will create devices like
/dev/rpmsg_pru30 that we could theoretically write and read packets
from.  But so far we haven't managed to demonstrate that.[2:

Sun Nov 12 14:19:43 2017 It seems perhaps like we need the 'correct'
crap on the PRU side for the LKM side 'probe' to create the devices.
There's these comments in PRU code like:

/*
 * Using the name 'rpmsg-client-sample' will probe the RPMsg sample driver
 * found at linux-x.y.z/samples/rpmsg/rpmsg_client_sample.c
 *
 * Using the name 'rpmsg-pru' will probe the rpmsg_pru driver found
 * at linux-x.y.z/drivers/rpmsg/rpmsg_pru.c
 */

so if my current demo fws aren't using the right sort of names..
..what name is my current demo using?[3:

Sun Nov 12 14:23:18 2017 Well, I guess it's using

    /*
     * Using the name 'rpmsg-pru-itcio' will probe the rpmsg_pru driver found
     * at linux-x.y.z/drivers/rpmsg/rpmsg_pru_itcio.c
     */
    #define CHAN_NAME					"rpmsg-pru-itcio"
    #define CHAN_DESC					"Channel 31"
    #define CHAN_PORT					31

according to pru/itcio/firmware/main_pru1.c[4:

Sun Nov 12 14:49:01 2017 Well it seems more the other way around.  I
copied the modules_install stuff from lkms/itc/Makefile, and after
running that, it seems that 'modprobe rpmsg_pru_itcio' boots the PRU:

    root@beaglebone:/home/t2/T2-12/pru/itcio/firmware# modprobe rpmsg_pru_itcio

    root@beaglebone:/home/t2/T2-12/pru/itcio/firmware#                

Committing this as a checkpoint, adding rpmsg_pru_itcio to my
/etc/modules stuff, and trying a reboot..
