Wed Jun 26 14:46:30 2019 Hmm, so looks like I lost some stuff on a
disk corruption, ick.  Wondering if I should move the keymaster while
I still have a chance.  I was talking about revising the design of the
T2-12 repo, or at least revisiting it.

file I started a while ago, once I noticed the FS had gone read-only
underneath me:

Among the issues:

1. We are using 'make cdmd' to build tgz-inside-of-mfz files to
   distribute updates to the grid.  cdm bulk transfer is way slow,
      like 9600 baud slow, so it would be better if such updates are
   not
      too huge.

2. In particular, cdmd-MFM.mfz is almost 10MB.

3. We need to actually IMPLEMENT cdm-deleteds.mfz, for example we stop
   trying to push the old-format 'cdm-distribu-*.mfz' files around!

4. We tried to speed this up by having a minimized 'cdmd-devbins.mfz'
   file, that just includes the 'important executable binaries'.[3:
   Wed Jun 26 14:55:15 2019 But any time there's more than one
   cdmd-X.mfz that includes a given file, that creates a race for that
   file since we have no way to express inter-cdmd-X.mfz dependencies,
   so whichever gets installed last wins.

5. Also, we have lots of files that are not inside T2-12, but are
   essential to tile functioning.  Most particularly including MFM and
   ULAM on the one hand, and tslib-1.20 for the touchscreen on the
   other hand.

Thu Jun 27 04:47:32 2019 OK, so we need to refresh and revisit our
make-an-image process, and.. make a new image..  Goals of the image:

 - Updated T2-12 and MFM.

 - Kill MFMTMP, it should not be needed anymore

 - Kill GFB ditto

 - Auto install of the T2-12 extras.  Does that already happen?

 - tslib-1.20 installed with a default configured pointercal

 - Current pubkey for cdm

 - Prepopulate /cdm/common?  Does that help?

 - Automate all of the above.
