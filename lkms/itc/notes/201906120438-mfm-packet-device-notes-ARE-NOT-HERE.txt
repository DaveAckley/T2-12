Wed Jun 12 04:40:43 2019 OK so it strikes me perhaps the easiest way
to provide separate packet access for mfm and cdm is to have the
itc_pkt module just provide separate devices for them, and use
our knowledge of the packet format to route incoming packets to the
two devices.  Aren't we already providing multiple character devices
from one module?  What's one more?[1:

Wed Jun 12 04:52:55 2019 (Calling this /dev/itc/mfm support v0.3 of
the module.)

So let's refresh on how things work here.

 - itc_init initializes the module and dynamically allocates a major
   device number, var majorNumber.

 - it creates class /sys/itccls, var itcClass.

 - it creates device /dev/itc/locks, var itcDevice.  What is
   /dev/itc/locks for, again, anyway?  [2: Wed Jun 12 05:00:30 2019
   It's for accessing and the state of the lock bits?  :2][3:

Wed Jun 12 05:03:45 2019 Jeez okay doh it's been forever here.  The
directory we are in, here, '/home/t2/T2-12/lkms/itc', is the module
JUST FOR THE LOCKS DOH NOT FOR THE PACKETS.

Please see
 /home/t2/T2-12/pru/itcio/notes/201901191229-intertile-model-notes.txt
for some as-recent-as-we-have discussion of intertile packet stuff.

(Reverting this module back to v0.2 doh.)
