Fri Oct  6 18:28:08 2017 We have four gpios involved in each pairwise
connection between two T2 tiles, two inputs and two outputs, that are
cross-coupled between tiles in the obvious way:

 xx_IRQLK:  Input Request LocK from direction xx
 xx_IGRLK:  Input Grant LocK from direction xx
 xx_ORQLK:  Output Request LocK in direction xx
 xx_OGRLK:  Output Grant LocK in direction xx


We will express input or output states as a binary pair with Request
first and Grant second:

00  IRQLK == 0, IGRLK == 0
01  IRQLK == 0, IGRLK == 1
10  IRQLK == 1, IGRLK == 0
11  IRQLK == 0, IGRLK == 0

[2: Sat Oct  7 02:36:20 2017

We can prefix such states with an 'i' to mean 'input' or an 'o' to
mean 'output':

'i01'   is a predicate meaning:  ((IRQLK == 0) && (IGRLK == 1))
'o10'   is an action meaning:    ORQLK = 1; OGRLK = 0;

and we can combine them to express a transition rule:

'i10>o01' meaning:  if ((IRQLK == 1) && (IGRLK == 0)) { ORQLK = 0; OGRLK = 1; }

We express internal state with an 's' followed by a state name:

sIDLE     Lock is open and no requests pending
sTAKE     We are attempting to take the lock
sTAKEN    We are successfully holding the lock
sGIVE     We are attempting to give the lock
sGIVEN    They are successfully holding the lock
sRESET    Lock system is reset
sSYNC     We are attempting to synchronize with our lock partner

o11 is not legal in the normal protocol, and it is the only such
state, so we use it to be the 'reset' state or ground state.  (So
IRQLK and IGRLK should have pullups enabled?)

When we read 11 we should reset our state (thus beginning to
output 11 as well), i.e., 'i11>s11' and 's11>o11'

When we enter the reset state our lock state becomes invalid and users
of the lock system should see that somehow.

Sat Oct  7 05:37:57 2017 Well, that can't be all right, and it ought
to be more symmetric I'd think, but it's plausibleish enough for a
start anyway.  And it leaves us wanting to shape up the execution
framework for it all, in terms of interrupts and timers.

[4:

Sun Oct  8 12:35:36 2017 Well, now we have T2-12/lkms/itc.ko working
far enough that about an hour ago, a T2-12 tile handled its first
interrupt from another tile and printk'd about it.  And it triggered
on both rising and falling edges, as desired.  So that was all pretty
good.

And that LKM also is running a kernel thread so that we can do
timeouts and stuff.  Right now the thread is only waking every ten
seconds or something, but it is waking repeatedly.

And so I'm back here trying to figure out what is the next step.  And
the suspicion would be the reset sequence, I guess.  With no requests
coming down from above (mfmt2 level), we should see no edges at all,
and should arrange for the thread to time out.

Suppose we try to do just that first.  Have the interrupt handler
record last active time, and have the thread run every few jiffies
and check if the last active time is too far in the past.[5:

Sun Oct  8 15:15:30 2017 OK, have that.  Looks like HZ=250 on the BBG,
so each jiffy is 4ms.  We do want the timeout stuff to be a backstop
for robustness, and the bulk of the time do work using the
edge-triggered interrupt.

We also want our state machine to be self-stabilizing, or idempotent,
or stimulus-response, or something like that, so that -- except for
timeouts -- our state won't change unless the input changes, and we
can therefore run the transition function any time or multiple times
without harm.

Could the interrupt routine be unique per pin?  And it would just read
that one and only pin, compare it to the stored value for that pin,
and trigger the transition function (with timeout == false) if it
changed?  And the transition function doesn't actually read any pins
at all, it just uses the stored values??

[6:

Sun Oct 8 15:25:30 2017 Let's see if we can make unique interrupt
handlers for each pin.  More YY XX magic; see if it works.[7:

Sun Oct  8 16:54:21 2017 Looks like that worked.  We now have separate
minimal interrupt handlers for each pin, that dish to a common handler
that successfully reading the value of the pin whose edge triggered
the interrupt.

Now, if we store the old value of the pin -- or read everything on
timeout -- we might be able to detect (single) lost interrupts and
trigger a reset.  But do we want to do that, rather than just wait a
while?  We might.

Mon Oct  9 01:38:26 2017 OK, for the last few hours we have had one
tile taking interrupts, and a second tile at his SE running a bash
loop that generates 100 edges on ORQ and OGR every nine seconds.  The
hero tile is remembering the state of each input, and counts a 'missed
edge' whenever an interrupt appears _not_ to cause the associated
input to change.

So far, the hero tile has taken about 264K interrupts, and detected
nine missed edges.

We'll just pause to let that sink in.

[9:

Mon Oct  9 01:51:32 2017 Missed another one; 10 so far, with about
270K interrupts taken.

Note the hero tile also been running mfms at generally >49AER this
whole time.

So here it is: In this test, our edge triggered interrupt handler is
catching well over 99.99% of the edges.  But it's also definitely
catching less than 100% of the edges.

So what do we do?

We want to go as fast as possible when taking an uncontested lock --
when we are in sIDLE and see a rising edge on IRQLK, we want to enter
sGIVE (and assert OGRLK) as quickly as possible.

On the other side, when we're in sTRY and see a rising edge on IGRLK,
we want to enter sTAKEN as quickly as possible, so we can report
uACQUIRED to the user (i.e., mfmt2).

We haven't done it yet, but if we do make this LKM also be a character
device, like /dev/itcs or something, then mfmt2 could do a lock
request by doing a one-byte write with the locks it wants, and then do
a one-byte read to see which locks it has.  And the LKM could block
that read until all sTRYs are resolved one way or the other.

That could allow parallelizing the lock tries across the ITCs, which
would be nice.  And if the one byte meant 'I want exactly these
locks', then writing a null byte would free everything.  And even ho
ho, conceivably, one could be holding some lock(s) and write a
non-null byte to free those and acquire some others.

But that would risk a fairness issue if I could write say 001100 and
then 000100 -- like going from a corner lock event to an edge lock
event -- without ever freeing the edge involved in both..

It also makes me wonder if we couldn't be just trying for and freeing
locks all the time, at the LKM level, so that responding to a user
lock request could be 'atomic' -- you either are currently holding
those locks (plus perhaps more, who knows) or you're not.  If you are,
those locks are put into 'persist' mode until you release them, while
any other locks continue to be tried and taken or granted and freed.

But having to luck into two specific locks simultaneously seems like a
losing game for those poor corners, though.  So let's not think that
way right now.

Given a user request for a set of locks, we do this:

 - Check the user state of each requested lock.  If any of them are
   uOPEN, mark this set as unavailable.

 - If the set is marked unavailable, set it to all zeros (free all)

 - Iterate over the set in a background-randomized order.
   = If we don't want the lock,
     - If it's {sTRY, sTAKEN} goto sIDLE
     - If it's uRESET or uBUSY or uOPEN, do nothing
     - Otherwise fail (uncovered state?)
   = If we do want the lock,
     - If it's sIDLE goto sTRY
     - If it's {sTRY, sTAKEN}, do nothing

[10:

Mon Oct  9 17:39:00 2017 OK, now we have background-shuffled
indices.. but we're not doing anything with them..

How can we get another little step to try, here?  Let's try to do some
kind of reset->idle sequence, brute force with timers.  Our goal is to
have itc.ko running on two tiles, and have both tiles get to idle with
each other.

[11:

Mon Oct  9 18:02:40 2017 Start in state sRESET, broadcasting 11.
Forget about the interrupt handler for now.  On timer tick, call
updateState(itc) or something in a dir-shuffled order.

In updateState(itc), read the two input pins.  Do a switch statement
on our state x their pins.  Have the switch statement do nothing but
call setState, which sets our state and updates our pins.

Go on to the next guy.  When done, sleep for a couple jiffies and then
do it again.   Every ten seconds or so, printk all our states (maybe
in dir-shuffled order for fun).

That is all.  Do it.
[12:

Tue Oct 10 05:54:45 2017 OK well we did that, before we slept some,
and it's not working of course.  The current problem looks to be the
sRESET->sSYNC11 idea, or thereabouts: The idea was both parties get to
sRESET and o11, and then one guy can move on to sSYNC11 to start the
path towards sSYNC01 and sSYNC00 and then to sIDLE.  (And we did,
briefly, see sIDLE once, but then it went to sRESET.)

And before trying to understand that further, I'd say here what about
being heretical and making the two sides of the connection asymmetric
for reset sequence purposes?  Two points:

(1) Unlike the IXMs that offered rotational and mirror symmetries for
    interconnection, the T2 tiles really really try hard to ensure
    there's only a single interconnection pattern: Only a fred and a
    ginger can interconnect, and then only via ET-WT, NE-SW, or NW-SE.

(2) I _think_ we don't care if the reset sequence is asymmetric as
    long as the subsequent lock taking process is symmetric.  We can't
    use fred vs ginger to prioritize who wins a contested lock -- we
    want to use something randomized somehow -- but it would make the
    reset sequence liiiiike super-easy right?

Suppose we say ginger moves first on reset, because that seems
marginally less sexist though it's always in the eyes of the beholder.
That means fred@sRESET (call it FsRESET) can see i01 and have it be
okay, but ginger cannot.  So, some rules:

   FsRESETi01 -> sSYNC01     GsRESETi11 -> sSYNC01
   FsRESETi.. -> sRESET      GsRESETi.. -> sRESET

   FsSYNC01i00 -> sSYNC00    GsSYNC01i11 -> sSYNC01
   FsSYNC01i.. -> sRESET     GsSYNC01i01 -> sSYNC00

   FsSYNC00i00 -> sIDLE      GsSYNC00i00 -> sIDLE

Which is fine as far as it goes but leaves us with still a race
between entering sIDLE and leaving it again by trying to take the
first lock.

(This can also fail if FsRESET sees a i01 before ginger enters reset.
Let's try again.)

  FsFAILEDi11 -> sRESET      GsFAILEDi11 -> sRESET        # i11 is the only way to get
  FsFAILEDi.. -> sFAILED     GsFAILEDi.. -> sFAILED       # from sFAILED to sRESET

                             GsRESETi11  -> sSYNC01       # ginger moves first from sRESET
  FsRESETi11  -> sRESET                                   # fred waits for ginger in sRESET
  FsRESETi01  -> sSYNC01                                  # fred reacts to ginger's move
  FsRESETi..  -> sFAILED     GsRESETi..  -> sFAILED       # anything else, try again

                             GsSYNC01i11 -> sSYNC01       # ginger waits for fred in sSYNC01
  FsSYNC01i01 -> sSYNC01                                  # fred waits for ginger in sSYNC01
                             GsSYNC01i01 -> sIDLE         # ginger moves first from sSYNC01
  FsSYNC01i00 -> sIDLE                                    # fred reacts to ginger's move
  FsSYNC01i.. -> sFAILED     GsSYNC01i.. -> sFAILED

                sIDLEi01 -> sIDLE                         # ignore leftover grants (from reset or uFREE)
                sIDLEi00 -> sIDLE                         # we're both idle
                sIDLEi10 -> sGIVE                         # they took the lock
                sGIVEi10 -> sGIVE                         # they're still holding the lock
                sGIVEi00 -> sIDLE                         # they freed the lock
                sIDLEuTRY -> sTAKE                        # try for the lock
                sTAKEi00 -> sTAKE                         # we're still hoping for the lock
                sTAKEi01 -> sTAKEN                        # we got the lock
                sTAKENi01-> sTAKEN                        # we're holding the lock
                sTAKENuFREE -> sIDLE                      # free the lock
