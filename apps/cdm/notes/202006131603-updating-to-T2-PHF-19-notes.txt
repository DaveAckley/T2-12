Sat Jun 13 16:03:23 2020 OK, we're in the middle of reorganizing the
packet header to follow T2-PacketHeaderFormats-19, and the changes
have consequences for CDM, so here we are.

Just surveying the scene first.  Where-all does cdm.pl examine packet
header bits?

 - $CDM_PKT_TYPE is 0x03, which doesn't have bit 7 set, so in
   T2-PHF-19 it will look like flash instead of bulk in byte1.
   Probably just change it to 0x80|0x03.

 - sendCMDTo does

    my $pkt = chr(0x80+$dest).chr($CDM_PKT_TYPE).$type;

   which is okay as long as $CDM_PKT_TYPE is changed.

 - And that might actually be it for updating cdm.pl?[1:

Sat Jun 13 16:18:00 2020 Well, cdm might be updated...[2:

Sat Jun 13 16:19:53 2020 While we're here, though, we might want to
tear out the user-button monitoring code, which previously was used to
launch t2viz.

Should do that as a separate commit though.[3:

Sat Jun 13 16:28:38 2020 OK, tore out a bunch of button-and-stats-prog
related code, but left some for possible future examples, marked as
currently unused.  Ran cdm.pl to see if it compiles, and it does, but
now the neigbhor's CDM packets are all illegal:

  ..
    Jun 13 16:27:55 beaglebone cdm.sh[1756]: ANNOUNCED cdm-distrib-T2-GFB.mfz to 0
    Jun 13 16:27:55 beaglebone cdm.sh[1756]: Discarded 3 packet(s) containing 169 byte(s)
    Jun 13 16:27:58 beaglebone cdm.sh[1756]: UNHANDLED PKT(‡#003F#026cdm-distrib-T2-GFB.mfz#0047603#020Ø#011 ©Ðñ£<ƒ#011ùˆBgãr
    Jun 13 16:27:58 beaglebone cdm.sh[1756]: 1559554678#0011)
  ..

so we'll need to get this pushed and pulled.

Although, after we install the LKM, those packets will get delivered
to /dev/itc/flash anyway..  Is mfmt2 reading flash yet?[4:

Sat Jun 13 16:32:26 2020 No, it's not.
