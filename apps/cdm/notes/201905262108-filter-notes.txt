Sun May 26 21:08:44 2019 OK, so we need to get some kind of
new-content-trigger going, so that we can update cdm based on
cdm-shared content.

Now, one fundamental problem with thinking about 'taking actions' or
'doing things' based on new content arrival is that 'newness' is not
idempotent.  How do we know if we've 'applied' some content or not --
which might, after all, have pretty arbitrary effects?

Could we have a 'last-successfully-applied' directory or file or
something?  For some content with a name on the trigger list, once the
trigger is successfully applied, we record that content in
last-successfully-applied and then only apply further matching content
that's different (and newer?) that the last applied.

Mon May 27 01:06:20 2019 OK so as a reminder, cdm.pl already has a
'checkTriggers' sub, based on a hardcoded %triggerMFZs map from MFZ
name to sub ref.  The only existing entry is

'cdm-deleteds.mfz' => \&updateDeleteds

but updateDeleteds currently just logs a message.

So should we pick up there at least to get going?  Oh and we has
started a cdmctl which I think was supposed to manage things like
cdm-deleteds.mfz?  Checking.

Mon May 27 17:37:40 2019 OK, so we're inching towards having creaky
but functional tgz distribution via cdm, so far for MFM and T2-12.

Current issues:
 - We just make files, we don't invoke 'make install' or any other
   specific targets.  Just making files is enough to update cdm.pl and
   things like mfzrun, which we are mostly running out of the tree
   anyway.  But it won't do for the .ko's and the prus and so on.

 - We still have to update a few files on every tile before the
   distribution works.  Not sure how we want to go about getting them
   out.  Needed files are at least:
   = t2 keymaster distribution pubkey
   = A new cdm.pl
   = A new mfzrun
